# Implementation-of-Symbol-Table-to-handle-nested-scopes

Instructions for input:
	The program searches for a file named "InputFile.txt" in the current folder (the path can be changed by altering the INPUTFILEPATH macro in utils.h)
	
	The program processes the file and creates three files: 
		1. "OutputFile.txt" which stores the output of the program
		2. "Log.txt" which can be used to find the status of each command executed
		3. "SymTable.txt" which stores the state of symbol table after every instruction 

Instructions for execution in Linux terminal:<br>
	./MainMake.sh
